## Young Miko: The Rising Star of Latin Trap

María Victoria Ramírez de Arellano, better known as Young Miko, is a Puerto Rican rapper and singer who has taken the Latin trap scene by storm. Despite only being in the music industry for a few years, she has already made a name for herself with her unique sound and Spanglish lyricism.

Young Miko started her career by dropping tracks on SoundCloud in 2018 under the name "Young Miko," which means "shaman of Christ" in Japanese. Her first song, "Quiero," garnered tens of thousands of streams, and she quickly gained a following on the platform. However, it was her song "105 Freestyle" that caught the attention of Bad Bunny and earned her wider visibility.

Since then, Young Miko has released her EP "Trap Kitty" in 2022, which has upended the sound of Latin trap with bouncy tracks and raunchy lyrics that speak directly to women. Her music videos for hits like "Riri" and "Lisa" have garnered 50 million views on YouTube, and she has amassed over 20 million monthly listeners on Spotify. Karol G, Ivy Queen, and Camila Cabello have all endorsed the artist.

But Young Miko's star power goes beyond her music. Via her unflinching rhymes and self-expression, she is also lending her voice to boost the LGBTQ+ community and women beyond her little island with a huge influence on music. Her music’s mix of hyper-femme aesthetics with raunchy lyrics is groundbreaking, and she is part of a new generation of queer femmes in Puerto Rico who are dreaming up rap and reggaeton’s future.

Young Miko is represented by Juan Toro at Wasserman Music, and she is currently on the road on her Trap Kitty tour. With her unique sound and powerful message, Young Miko is definitely an artist to watch in the Latin trap scene.
