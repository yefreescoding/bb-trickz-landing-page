### LA BLACKIE IS THE HOUSE:

Saint Levant’s career started with the help of TikTok and Instagram, where he has amassed around 150,000 followers and hundreds of millions of views. His first single “Jerusalem Freestyle” was released in late 2020 and garnered hundreds of thousands of streams, followed up by an even bigger success – **“Nirvana in Gaza”**.

After that, the 21 year old struggled with maintaining a balance between his startup company connecting Palestinians in the diaspora to investment opportunities, university obligations, content creation, political activism, podcasting and personal life – which led to scattered musical output. However, late 2021 and early 2022 has seen him dedicate himself to his childhood dream of becoming an artist, releasing over 10 singles and performing live for the first time ever.

He also composed the song ‘Tourist’, reflecting on how he feels like a tourist when he visits his birthplace. Palestine is a big part of his identity and he claims to only feel at home when he is in Gaza. Additionally, his 2048 Fellowship, a one-year stipend, helps ground-breaking Palestinian artists by covering their living expenses.
