## Music.

Up until the COVID pandemic, music was Price’s private hobby. Something personal, offstage, just for him. But when the pandemic pulled Hollywood to a halt, “Things just completely slowed down for me for the first time in my life where I was like, ‘I don’t know what to do with my time,'” Price says. Being stuck at home was “the perfect excuse for me to just go all in on music” and start sharing it with other people.

Price began putting out a song once every two weeks, or even once a week at his most prolific. To promote them, he started a TikTok account, and “that’s where everything just blew up,” he says.

Price now has 5 million followers on TikTok and just over 2 million subscribers on YouTube–and going all in on music (with production help from family and friends) has given him the kind of creative freedom he’s never known.
